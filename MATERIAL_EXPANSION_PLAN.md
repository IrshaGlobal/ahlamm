## 📈 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Dataset Impact:
**Current**: 8,000 samples, 6 combinations → ~1,333 samples per combination  
**Proposed**: Target 32,000 samples, 32 combinations → ~1,000 samples per combination

**Recommendation**: Generate 32,000 samples to maintain statistical validity
- More combinations = need more data for model generalization
- 1,000+ samples per combination = adequate for deep learning

### Model Impact:
**Input Layer Changes**:
- Current: 2 materials × 2 blades = 4 categorical features → 2 one-hot encoded features
- Proposed: 6 materials × 6 blades = 12 categorical features → 10 one-hot encoded features
- **Input dimension increase**: ~8 additional features

**Expected Performance**:
- ✅ Lifespan & Wear: Should maintain high accuracy (physics-based)
- ⚠️ Efficiency: Already lowest R² (0.69) - may decrease slightly with more combinations
- **Mitigation**: Increase model capacity (128→256 first layer) or use material-specific sub-models

### App Impact:
**UI Changes**:
- Dropdown menus will have more options (6 each instead of 2-3)
- Friction coefficient auto-calculation needs update
- Material-specific recommendations need expansion
- Invalid combinations need handling (e.g., Steel + PCD → warning message)

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Model accuracy drops** | Medium | High | Increase dataset to 32K, add validation per material |
| **Invalid combinations used** | High | Medium | Add combination validation logic in app |
| **Physics parameters incorrect** | Low | Critical | Cross-reference multiple sources (ASM, Kalpakjian) |
| **Training time increases** | High | Low | Use early stopping, cloud GPU if needed |
| **App becomes cluttered** | Medium | Medium | Use expandable sections, tooltips |
| **Thesis defense questions** | High | Medium | Document ALL sources, provide sensitivity analysis |

## 🎓 THESIS DEFENSE PREPARATION

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. **Physics-Informed Approach**: All Taylor constants from ASM Handbook Vol. 16
2. **Material Compatibility**: Invalid combinations identified and handled
3. **Scalability**: Systematic approach can extend to more materials
4. **Validation**: Cross-referenced multiple engineering references
5. **Transparency**: All assumptions and sources documented

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Why synthetic data instead of real measurements?"**  
A: No public dataset exists with full parameter coverage. Physics-informed synthetic data is standard for digital twin applications. Real validation would be future work.

**Q: "How do you know Taylor constants are accurate?"**  
A: Cross-referenced ASM Handbook Vol. 16, Machining textbooks (Kalpakjian), and published machining databases. Values are industry-standard.

**Q: "Why exclude Steel+PCD combination?"**  
A: PCD (polycrystalline diamond) reacts with ferrous materials at high temperatures, causing rapid tool wear. This is well-documented in cutting tool literature.

**Q: "Did model accuracy decrease with more materials?"**  
A: [Check actual results after training] Expected slight decrease (5-10%) due to increased complexity, but still within acceptable range for early-stage design tool.

**Q: "How would you validate this with real data?"**  
A: Partner with manufacturing lab, conduct controlled cutting tests on 5-10 representative combinations, compare predictions to measurements, adjust model if needed.
