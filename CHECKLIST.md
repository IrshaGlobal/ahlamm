# ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying or presenting your thesis project.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Files Present
- [ ] All 5 model files (`.h5`) exist in `model/` directory
- [ ] `preprocessor.pkl` exists
- [ ] `api/main.py` FastAPI backend exists
- [ ] `frontend/index.html` web UI exists
- [ ] `server.py` combined server exists
- [ ] `requirements.txt` is up to date (no Streamlit)
- [ ] `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11
- [ ] `README.md` is complete and accurate
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files
- [ ] No Streamlit files remain

### Application Testing
- [ ] App starts without errors: `python server.py`
- [ ] Web UI loads at http://localhost:8000
- [ ] API docs accessible at http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- [ ] All 5 models load successfully (check console output)
- [ ] Ensemble averaging message appears
- [ ] Input controls (number inputs) are responsive
- [ ] Predictions generate within 2 seconds
- [ ] Visualization displays correctly
- [ ] No console errors during prediction
- [ ] Performance score calculates correctly
- [ ] All 10 training parameters present in UI

### Model Validation
- [ ] All models have validation loss < 25
- [ ] Best model (seed 1337) has val_loss ~23.7
- [ ] Ensemble predictions are reasonable:
  - Lifespan: 1-15 hours
  - Wear: 5-95%
  - Efficiency: 60-98%

## üöÄ Deployment Preparation

### Repository Cleanup
- [ ] No `__pycache__` directories
- [ ] No `.pyc` files
- [ ] No large log files (>10MB)
- [ ] No training artifacts (unless needed)
- [ ] Git status is clean or has only intentional changes

### Documentation Review
- [ ] README.md explains project clearly
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md has accurate instructions
- [ ] PROJECT_SUMMARY.md reflects current state
- [ ] All file paths in docs are correct
- [ ] Dependencies versions are specified

### Code Quality
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (use `Path` objects)
- [ ] Error handling is in place
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] No debugging print statements
- [ ] Code is commented where necessary

---

## üéì Thesis Defense Preparation

### Demo Scenarios
- [ ] Prepare 3 example blade configurations:
  1. Optimal (low wear, high efficiency)
  2. Average (balanced performance)
  3. Poor (high wear, low efficiency)
- [ ] Test all scenarios before defense
- [ ] Screenshot results for backup slides
- [ ] Practice explaining ensemble concept

### Talking Points
- [ ] Understand ensemble benefits (variance reduction)
- [ ] Explain custom loss function (Huber for wear)
- [ ] Describe training dataset (10,000 samples)
- [ ] Know validation metrics (~23.7 best)
- [ ] Understand deployment options

### Backup Plan
- [ ] Have offline version ready (in case internet fails)
- [ ] Screenshots of typical predictions
- [ ] Recorded demo video (optional)
- [ ] Slide deck with architecture diagrams

---

## üåê Platform-Specific Checks

### Hugging Face Spaces
- [ ] Account created at huggingface.co
- [ ] Space name chosen
- [ ] `runtime.txt` and `requirements.txt` in root
- [ ] Test deployment to private space first
- [ ] Public space working and accessible

### Railway/Render
- [ ] Account created
- [ ] GitHub repo connected
- [ ] Start command configured
- [ ] Environment variables set (if needed)
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding

### Docker
- [ ] Dockerfile builds without errors
- [ ] Container runs locally: `docker run -p 8501:8501 ahlamm`
- [ ] App accessible at `localhost:8501`
- [ ] Image size reasonable (<2GB)

---

## üéØ Performance Verification

### Speed Tests
- [ ] Cold start (first load): <10 seconds
- [ ] Model loading: <5 seconds
- [ ] Single prediction: <100ms
- [ ] Page responsiveness: smooth

### Memory Usage
- [ ] App uses <1GB RAM
- [ ] No memory leaks during prolonged use
- [ ] Ensemble loads all models without OOM

### Reliability

- [ ] Colors are accessible
- [ ] Controls are intuitive
- [ ] Help text is clear

### Functionality
- [ ] All sliders work smoothly
- [ ] Dropdown menus respond
- [ ] Buttons trigger correct actions
- [ ] Visualizations are interactive
- [ ] Results update in real-time

### Mobile Responsiveness (Optional)
- [ ] Layout adapts to smaller screens

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Code Security
