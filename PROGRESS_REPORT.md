## 🎯 **KEY DECISIONS MADE**

### ✅ Confirmed by User:
1. **Materials:** 6 to cut + 7 blade materials (including 2 coated carbide variants)
2. **Blade Types:** Straight, Circular, Insert/Replaceable Tip, Toothed
3. **Outputs:** ONLY 4 metrics (Lifespan, Wear, Efficiency, Performance Score)
4. **NO market analysis:** No cost/economics outputs (this is engineering thesis!)
5. **3D visualization:** Important but can be implemented later (Phase 2)
6. **Data:** Synthetic data now, can update with real data later (easy retrain)

### ❌ Rejected (User Correction):
1. ~~Blade types: Turning, Milling, Drill, Grooving~~ (WRONG!)
2. ~~Material Removal Rate output~~ (NOT REQUESTED!)
3. ~~Surface Roughness output~~ (NOT REQUESTED!)
4. ~~Power Consumption output~~ (NOT REQUESTED!)
5. ~~Tool Cost per Part output~~ (NOT REQUESTED!)

**Lesson:** Stick EXACTLY to user requirements. This is an engineering thesis, not a market analysis tool!
