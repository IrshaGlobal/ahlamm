## 🚨 RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### High-Risk Items
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Model R² < 0.95 | ⚠️ HIGH | Low | Ensemble, more data, physics loss |
| Data not physically valid | ⚠️ HIGH | Low | Expert review, literature validation |
| 3D rendering too slow | Medium | Low | Optimize mesh, use efficient library |
| Timeline overrun | Medium | Medium | Prioritize core, defer nice-to-haves |

### Mitigation Actions
```
If Model Accuracy Insufficient:
1. Increase dataset size (60K → 100K)
2. Strengthen physics constraints
3. Add more ensemble models (5 → 10)
4. Hyperparameter optimization (Bayesian search)

If 3D Rendering Slow:
1. Reduce mesh resolution (still visually good)
2. Use WebGL acceleration
3. Add loading indicator
4. Implement caching

If Timeline Pressured:
1. Phase 1 & 2 are MUST-HAVE (data + model)
2. Phase 3 advanced viz can be simplified
3. Phase 4 testing can be streamlined
```
