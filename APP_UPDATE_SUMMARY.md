## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Model Performance:
- Lifespan: **0.95** ✅ (Excellent)
- Wear: **0.90** ⚠️ (Good, just below target)
- Efficiency: **0.68** ⚠️ (Moderate - challenging to predict)
- Overall: **0.84** ⚠️ (Good for thesis, can improve later)

### Why Efficiency is Lower:
- Complex multi-factor interactions
- Non-linear relationships
- Inherent noise in synthetic data
- **Solution**: Can retrain with real data later

✅ **Scalability** - Expanded from 6 to 168 combinations  
✅ **Engineering Knowledge** - All 6 materials + 7 blade types + 4 blade types  
✅ **User Experience** - Comprehensive recommendations system  
✅ **Physics Integration** - Material-specific friction coefficients  
✅ **Practical Application** - Real-world blade optimization tool

### What to Write:
> "The blade optimization system was successfully expanded to support 168 material combinations, covering 6 workpiece materials (Steel, Stainless Steel, Aluminum, Cast Iron, Brass, Titanium), 7 blade materials (from HSS to PCD), and 4 blade types (Straight, Circular, Insert/Replaceable Tip, Toothed). The system provides material-specific and blade type-specific recommendations based on predicted performance metrics."
